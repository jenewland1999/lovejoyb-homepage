# Lovejoy B - Homepage

A single-page, static personal website for a client to replace their rather dull and plain-looking parking page previously setup on the domain. The website was first designed in Adobe XD and presented to the client for review before development began. Development took place using the familiar web technologies HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The CSS pre-compiler Sass and JavaScript compiler Babel were also used.
